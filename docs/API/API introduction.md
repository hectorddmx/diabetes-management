# API introduction
To handle the backend we'll use a freely available API from [http://www.jadediabetes.com/api/](http://www.jadediabetes.com/api/)

They already have iOS and Android apps but we'll just ignore them for the task at hand.

To be able to guide you with the API they have the following pages to help you.
Documentation page: http://www.jadediabetes.com/api/api-rest/
Playground page: https://app.jadediabetes.com/api/sample.html

**Before being able to use the API, we'll create a new account from their website in their [signup page](https://app.jadediabetes.com/signup.html).**

After we created the account, we can start playing around with their basic API.

Endpoints we'll use for the current project
- [[GET - Login]]
- [[API/METHODS/GET - Submit blood glucose value]]
- [[GET - Fetch user blood glucose levels]]
